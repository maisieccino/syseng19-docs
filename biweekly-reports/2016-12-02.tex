\noindent {\Large \bf Overview}
\smallskip

\noindent
Over the last two weeks, the team focused mainly on completing most of the research required for the final structure of the system. The research included which technologies to be used for developing the final system (which backend/frontend framework and libraries) and completed the matching algorithm design with pseudocode. A wireframe prototype was also created based on the sketches that were produced during the earlier stages of development. We were also constantly updating and adding content to the project website based on the research we have done.

\noindent{\Large \bf Meetings To Date}
\smallskip

\begin{description}
  \item[Meeting 1, n\textsuperscript{th} of Month Year] --- During this meeting we covered this and accomplished this. We also set our goals for the next period of time.
  \item[Meeting 2, n\textsuperscript{th} of Month Year] --- In this meeting we met with our client and established this. We then confirmed that x might be the best way to go about y.
\end{description}

\bigskip
\noindent{\Large \bf Completed Tasks}
\smallskip

\noindent
Since the previous report these are the tasks that have been completed to date:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Task 1
  \item Task 2
  \item Task 3
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent{\Large \bf Chris' Progerss}
\smallskip

\noindent
I have mostly been working on this and that. \\

\bigskip
\noindent{\Large \bf Harry's Progress}
\smallskip

\noindent
My responsibility over the past two weeks has mainly been in the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Developing this \href{http://google.com}{component demo}.
  \item Prototyping this part of the application
  \item Designing the component for that
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
\noindent{\Large \bf Matt's Progress}
\smallskip

\noindent
Since the last report I have been focusing my efforts on researching the potential technologies for the project. \\

\noindent
Through my research I have determined that some of the aforementioned technologies would bring a tangible benefit to the development of the application and the end product. \\

\bigskip
\noindent{\Large \bf Problems To Resolve}
\smallskip

\noindent
Not many problems have been encountered, however the following need to be addressed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\it Problem 1\/} --- This could be solved by implementing x.
  \item {\it Problem 2\/} --- We could lessen this problem by using y to communicate more.
  \item {\it Problem 3\/} --- This should be avoided by ensuring that everyone is familiar and up to speed with our chosen source control \href{http://git-scm.com}{Git}.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\noindent{\Large \bf Plan For The Next Two Weeks}
\smallskip

\noindent
Over the next two weeks we will be focusing on the following activities:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Proceding to begin work on this
  \item Finalising our designs
  \item Ensuring our requirements are correct
\end{itemize}
